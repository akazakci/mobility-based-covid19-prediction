# Mobility-based-covid19-prediction

Full pipeline from data download to simulation of Covid19 occurences through ML models.

This project uses Facebook data from [Data for Good](https://dataforgood.fb.com/) to model and predict the spread of Coronavirus (Covid-19) based on population characteristics such as mobility patterns and population density. It is part of the epidemic response PSL University has developped.

You need to have access to Facebook's data in order to make full use of the scripts. If you are interested in the models and collaboration feel free to contact me.

Disclaimer: The code and the project is not associated with Facebook in anyway.
